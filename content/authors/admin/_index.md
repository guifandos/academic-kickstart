I combine empirical data, fieldwork, and quantitative methods to improve our understanding of how natural and anthropogenic changes influence biodiversity dynamics.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the The biodiversity modelling lab (Universität Potsdam). Currently, I am working on understanding how life history and environment shape dispersal in birds.
